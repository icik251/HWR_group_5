Style Classification of Dead Sea Scrolls

Instructions:
Use Matlab on Windows (had no time to switch to Linux)
0. Start Matlab
1. Set Matlab's current working folder to this folder with the program files.
2. In Matlabs's command line, run the function 'StyleClassifier' with a folder path as argument.
   For example: StyleClassifier( 'path/to/test/images/' )
3. Wait for the training and classification.
4. results can later be found as txt files in the folder 'results/'.

The program classifies pages of the dead sea scrolls by counting the number
of SIFTinvariant features that match between their writing and 
the provided sets of letters that belong to 
the three classes, Archaic, Hasmonean, and Herodian.

programmable files:
StyleClassifier: Contains the main function that classifies based on log ratios between numbers of matches with styles.
AllSiftFeatures: iterates through the subfolders of letters, downsamples them and returns all their sift features.
CountTotalMatches: Splits the full images and Counts their matches with the features of letters.
A further script 'ScoreSixPages' is provided which classifies six pages without training on pages, but only on the letters. It could be mentioned in the final report.

Our implementation is based on a SIFT demo by David Lowe (lowe@cs.ubc.ca)
 (Version 4, July 6, 2005) that is capable of extracting features and matching them.
I adapted the program to read all the subfolders containing the images of letters.
The original SIFT feature extraction was unable to handle the size of the full images, which I solved by splitting the images.
The original matching algorithm failed when an image had less than two features, which I had to fix as well.
The original program was not a classifier, but I programmed it to do classificaion.
The images are downsampled by a factor of 3 in order to avoid noise caused by irrelevant small scale patters.
